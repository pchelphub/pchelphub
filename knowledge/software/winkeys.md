# Main licence types
## OEM
* cheaper 
* Designed to be used by a system builder, key to be installed during the system build, installs to the BIOS -> Normally locked to the system but there are versions which activate more than once.
## Retail
* bit more expensive
* transferable between systems, theoretically usable indefinitely
* Full packaged product is the most common. Before transfer it must be deactivated.
* There are other retail types (i.e. single activation), but iirc you should generally see only the reusable
 * generally, retail keys are less than twice as much the price of the OEM keys and thus provide a better value at least for the time being since you can simply reuse them when you buy a new PC
 * There are also more types/subscriptions (i.e. MAK/VL - Volume license/multiple applications, M365, Static (bypass activation), AVMA (when a host licenses a VM)), but you will mostly see the OEM and Retail keys on sale in places like PCPP

## Pro? Home?
### Home Edition
* The basic edition of windows
* Keys are usually cheaper than the Pro edition
### Professional Edition
* has specific features that the Home edition doesn't, such as built-in virtualization manager or built in remote desktop software
* Professional licence keys tend to be more expensive
  * My general recommendation is - if you don't know how the editions differ, or how you would use any of the features Pro edition has, go for the Home edition and save money

## 64-bit vs 32-bit editions
* That simply denotes for which systems the keys are for
* Nowadays, most consumer systems are 64-bit, and thus you don't really need the 32-bit version, so if a 64-bit only key is cheaper than a 64/32-bit key, go for the 64-bit one.

## DVD? USB? Download?
* USB Drive edition
* DVD Drive edition
* Download edition
 * now this is pretty simple - one comes with an installation USB in the box, one with a DVD, and one with nothing and you have to make your own installation media (which is free)

## Free alternatives
* Whilst Windows is technically free, there are many operating systems that are free, opensource and you don't break their ToS by using them for free. Most if not all of the ones you should consider are various Linux distributions. Getting used to Linux might take some time, but depending on your usage it can result in a relatively painless experience.
* The app support on Linux distributions can vary, but usually if some apps aren't available, there are free and often open source alternatives. For example most Steam games, ones that don't have a 3rd party launcher, do work pretty seamlessly. 
* I personally am used to and am using Ubuntu based Linux distributions, namely Linux Mint and Linux Lite, but there is a ton of options for you to choose from, that don't even have to be based on Ubuntu. For example Valve's SteamOS is based on Arch. Besides these base pillars, there are also various Desktop Environments to customize your experience to your liking.

### What you could do if you are unsure if Linux is for you
* You can install Linux alongside Windows
* You can install Windows and try Linux inside a virtual machine
* you can create a bootable Linux USB and boot into a so called live session to at least check out the looks

## To sum up
The only person who can pick the right operating system for you absolutely correctly are you. Consider what you are doing, what you are willing to learn, and what trade-offs you are willing to make, and base your decision upon that. Be safe with online purchases, too.
