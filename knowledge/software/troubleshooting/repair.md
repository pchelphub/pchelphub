A system files repair tool I made in batch. You can use either the file itself (sysfile-repair.bat) and run it as administrator after downloading, or the downloader variant that will download the file for you and start it as administrator.
It uses DISM.exe in online mode, which will use Windows Update to download necessary files and SFC, which is an offline tool that replaces needed files with a local backup.

Windows Defender might scream about it not being signed, or other AVs might dislike the downloader, just press 'more' and 'run anyway', there is nothing I can do about that at least at the moment.
**My github is not public yet, but it will work eventually**
