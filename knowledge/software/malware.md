This is for information with regards to assisting users to remove their malware. There are common tools, procedures and commands which we regularly use. To save posting the same things over and over, we are collating them here. 

# FRST
Run Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST) to generate two log files that can help in identifying issues on your system.

* 1. Download Farbar Recovery Scan Tool (FRST) from the following link: [FRST Link](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/farbar-recovery-scan-tool/)
* 2. Run the FRST64.exe file.
* 3. Click on the **"Scan"** button.
* 4. The program will scan your system and create two log files: FRST.txt and Addition.txt, in this location: **C:\FRST\logs**
5. Send the log files here into this chat, drag and drop them here or attach them.

## Note:

* On some versions of Windows, a **"Windows protected your PC"** prompt may appear after running FRST. This is because FRST is not a Microsoft-approved application, and Windows may block its execution. If this happens, click on **"More info"** and then **"Run anyway"** to continue with the scan.
* Please note that the logs generated by FRST are primarily diagnostic and **do not** typically contain personal information.

# SentinelOne (S1)
SentinelOne is an extremely powerful antivirus/antimalware/cybersecurity solution that uses artificial intelligence to prevent and remove malware, and includes many state of the art addons and technologies. This software is typically used by corporations. 

We manage S1 for you (via a cloud console called **Singularity**), which means we can keep your device(s) protected from the latest threats. If any suspicious activity is detected, we'll also get a notification.

> We do not charge for this service; it is given by our own **good will**. We are under **no obligation** to continue to provide any such service. 

> Advisors @eduard. and @anothergame_3 have the ability to disinfect and inspect malware through S1. [slydelv](https://github.com/slydelv) provides the platform and oversees the security and configuration. 

There is no remote control of your computer available to our advisors through this platform; it is completely disabled.
