# F-Secure
F-Secure is a lightweight, non-intrusive antivirus solution with a clean interface. It is based in Finland and is autonomous and simple, with no settings that can be changed to improve protection. It is perfect for the average home user but may not be as appealing to the tech-savvy. The behavior blocking component, called DeepGuard, is quite effective, but it cannot perform malware rollback and sometimes leaves malware remnants (which are generally not dangerous).

F-Secure can be considered a "dual-engine" antivirus, where the main protection comes from the Avira engine (unlike other AVs, it also uses their cloud), and their own engine is mostly used as a supplement. The overall protection is very good, and in a recent test, it had the best banking protection. However, the ransomware protection is not particularly noteworthy. F-Secure relies heavily on its cloud and DeepGuard features, with much of the malware being blocked after execution.

Other positive aspects of F-Secure include its privacy features and excellent customer support. It also provides a detailed whitepaper on their behavior-blocking feature called DeepGuard (https://www.f-secure.com/content/dam/f-secure/en/business/computer-protection/collaterals/digital/f-secure-deepguard-whitepaper.pdf) for users who want to learn more about how it works. Overall, F-Secure is a good antivirus option for users who prioritize simplicity and good overall protection, with additional features like banking protection and privacy features.
