## Group Regulation vs DC-DC Converters

### Group Regulation
Group regulation is used in mainly in cheaper power supplies and works by regulating the 12V and 5V rails together, which can cause the rails to go out of the Â±5% ATX specification during crossload tests.

**Some Power Supplies that use Group Regulation:**
Corsair VS (Orange Label)
Evga N1
Thermaltake Smart RGB (230V)
Thermaltake Litepower RGB

### DC-DC Converters
DC-DC converters also called Voltage Regulator Modules are a form of independent regulation used in most power supplies nowadays, a power supply that utilizes DC-DC conversion generates the 5V and 3.3V rail from the 12V rail which those will go on to be regulated independently.

**Some Power Supplies that use DC-DC converters:**
Corsair RMx (All units)
NZXT C (All units)
Asus TUF Bronze
MWE Bronze V2

You should know that just because a power supply is using dc-dc doesn't mean you should buy it.
