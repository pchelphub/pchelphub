# What about $100?

$100 is weird in the mic world. At the $100 price mark, most mics do not have an integrated ADC and USB output. However, because of this, you'll need an XLR interface. If you have an XLR interface already, and are looking for a mic at $100, refer to the $200 section.

# Around $200

# $+?
I am choosing not to add anything more expensive. Why? Well, for one, the average user won't need more than this. And, if you do need more, you should do specialized research based on your own needs, not recommendations based on a massive generalisation of what a microphone needs to do. 

# XLR Interfaces
This is not every single XLR interface ever made. I encourage you to do your own research on what you need.

| Mark of the Unicorn (MOTU) M2       | $199.95    | $199.95            | 2 x XLR/Line Combo | Yes, I/O   | USB Type C    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Native Instruments Komplete Audio 2 | $139.00    | $99.00             | 2 x XLR/Line Combo | No         | USB Type B    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Native Instruments Komplete Audio 1 | $109.00    | $89.00             | 1 x XLR, 1 x Line  | No         | USB Type B    | While this is a good option if you're on a tight budget, its normally well worth it to spend a tiny bit more and get a KA2, however, this unit does in fact allow you to have a microphone and Line input at the same time, unlike some other solo units. |
| Arturia MiniFuse 2                  | $149.00    | $149.00            | 2 x XLR/Line Combo | Yes, I/O\* | USB Type C    | This is a great interface. There are a few quirks with it, so I encourage you to watch a review on it, but especially if you're looking for a white interface, this is the one.                                                                           |
| Arturia MiniFuse 1                  | $99.00     | $99.00             | 1 x XLR/Line Combo | No\*       | USB Type C    | Same statements from the MiniFuse 2 apply here. However, since this unit, unlike the KA1, doesn't allow you to connect a mic and an instrument/other Line at the same time, I'd think about the MiniFuse 2 or one of the Komplete Audio units.            |

\*The Arturia MiniFuse 1 and 2 have a USB Type A port on them that forwards to your computer over the main USB Type C connection. This means that you could plug in a MIDI device to this port that uses the USB connector, instead of the old-style MIDI connector. So in a way, even the MiniFuse 1 has MIDI support.
