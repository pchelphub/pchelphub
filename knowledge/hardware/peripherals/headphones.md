**Do take note that our recommendations are per total price to make them worth a buy. Which means that headphones that need an amp to sound as they should will have a value amp included in the price.**

<u><strong>ONLY GET APPLE DONGLE IF YOU'RE IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT IT'S BETTER TO GET A CX31993 DAC CHIP DONGLE LIKE MEIZU LIFEME ANYWAY</strong></u>

<u><strong><em>The Schiit Magni + is what we would recommend if it's available for you. It's better then the Ifi zen can and air can. But Schiit isn't available for everyone, hence why they are both in this document.</em></strong></u>
