#### For these units, we recommend a CX31993 dongle, like the [Meizu MBLUHIFI/LifemeHIFI](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B42ZML9S/). [Moondrop Click (DAC unknown)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BGX5Q2SQ) is a good option as well. If you're outside of the EU, the [Apple Dongle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K25P3N1/) (also avalible [for Lightning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LXJFMGF/)) is also acceptable.

This price is because we highly, highly recommend foam tips. The fit of these are very loose and can be a issue if you have oily skin or ears. The only company that currently do foam tips that fit the Pixel Buds Pro case is Comply and they cost around $25 for 3 pairs which last around 2 years with moderate use. |

# $200+
#### Please get a somewhat decent DAC/AMP for these (except for the TWS buds of course). The "Total setup price" column will be left out, as this is around the price where you should seek specialised help on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/PCHH).
