Hello guys and gals.
News have been popping up that ~~Giggleshite's~~ Gigabyte's NVIDIA 30 and 40 series GPUs are cracking near the PCIe retention clip. 
It happens due to lack of reinforcing in the clip area in combination with the weight of the card. When this happens, certain critical lines are broken and the card is rendered useless.

Reportedly, Gigabyte is also not keen on taking in RMAs on such cards and they simply send them back to the user with a red arrow sticker pointing at the crack (see image).
This is a relatively new issue media wise so we have yet to see where it gets, for now we have no official statements on the issue.

All I can tell you is that if you have a thicc expensive card, maybe an anti-sag bracket isn't that bad of an idea.

You can hear more info and some opinions here in [Louis's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFgsL5NFn_Y)
and for shits and giggles, here is a [repair guide](https://repair.wiki/w/Repairing_a_Cracked_Gigabyte_30_or_40_series), though I don't expect most of you to go and try to repair such cards

Vertical mounting is also an option if your case supports it.
